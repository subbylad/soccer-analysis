# CLAUDE.md - Soccer Analytics Project Memory

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is an **AI-powered soccer scout** built on top of a comprehensive Python-based soccer analytics toolkit. The project has evolved from basic analytics into an intelligent system that combines GPT-4 reasoning with soccer data analysis to create a conversational scout interface.

**Current Goal**: Complete transformation into **Soccer Scout AI** - a chat-first interface with GPT-4 intelligence that can handle complex tactical queries like "Who can play alongside Kobbie Mainoo in Ligue 1?" and provide tactical reasoning.

## 📊 Current Data & Coverage
- **Source**: FBref (Football Reference) 2024/25 season data
- **Scale**: 2,853 players from 96 teams across Big 5 European leagues
- **Data Types**: Standard stats, shooting, passing, defense metrics
- **Location**: `data/clean/` contains processed CSV files ready for analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture & Key Components

### Core Analysis Engine (`analysis/`)
- **`CleanPlayerAnalyzer`**: Main analysis class - the heart of the system
- **`utils.py`**: Shared utilities including potential scoring algorithm and position filtering
- **Specialized modules**: Young DM scouting, position-specific analysis
- **Key Features**: Player search, comparison, prospect identification, statistical analysis

### 🧠 GPT-4 Enhanced Natural Language API (`api/`) 
- **`main_api.py`**: Central coordinator with OpenAI integration support
- **`query_processor.py`**: **NEW** 4-tier query processing with GPT-4 tactical analysis
- **`analysis_router.py`**: Routes queries including new TacticalAnalysisRequest type
- **`response_formatter.py`**: Creates chat-friendly responses with scout reasoning
- **`types.py`**: Enhanced with `TacticalAnalysisRequest` for complex scout queries

### User Interfaces (`dashboards/`)
- **`web_dashboard.py`**: Full Streamlit dashboard (port 8501)
- **`chat_interface.py`**: Conversational interface using the API
- **`simple_chat.py`**: Lightweight chat interface (port 8503)
- **`quick_demo.py`**: Command-line demonstration tool

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. Player Analysis
```python
from analysis.clean_player_analyzer import CleanPlayerAnalyzer
analyzer = CleanPlayerAnalyzer()
players = analyzer.search_players("Pedri")
comparison = analyzer.compare_players(["Haaland", "Mbappé"])
```

### 2. GPT-4 Enhanced Tactical Queries
```python
from api.main_api import SoccerAnalyticsAPI, APIConfig
# Initialize with OpenAI support
config = APIConfig(openai_api_key="your-key-here")
api = SoccerAnalyticsAPI(config)

# Traditional queries (pattern matching)
result = api.query("Compare Haaland vs Mbappé")

# Complex tactical queries (GPT-4 enhanced)
result = api.query("Who can play alongside Kobbie Mainoo in Ligue 1?")
result = api.query("Find an alternative to Rodri for Man City's system")
```

### 3. Young Prospect Scouting
- **Potential Scoring Algorithm** with configurable weights:
  - Goals/assists per 90 (3.0x weight)
  - Expected goals/assists (5.0x weight) 
  - Progressive actions (0.05x/0.02x weight)
  - Age factor (10.0x * (23 - age))
- **Tier Classification**: Elite ⭐, High 🌟, Good 💫, Developing 📈

## 🚀 How to Run

### Modern Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
# Start backend API server
python3 api_server.py --port 5001 --debug

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd soccer-scout-ui && npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000
```

### GPT-4 Enhanced API Testing
```bash
# Test basic functionality (works without OpenAI key)
python3 tests/test_api.py

# Test GPT-4 enhanced tactical queries
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Set your OpenAI API key
python3 test_gpt_integration.py
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED (Jan 2025)**

### ⚠️ **Known Issues & Solutions for Future Development:**

#### **1. Frontend API Route Fallback Issue**
**Problem**: `soccer-scout-ui/src/app/api/query/route.ts` had extensive mock data fallback that prevented backend connection.
**Solution**: Removed mock response functions, hardcoded Railway backend URL, simplified error handling.
**Files Fixed**: `src/app/api/query/route.ts`
**Lesson**: Avoid elaborate fallback systems in production - they mask real connection issues.

#### **2. React Hook Demo Fallback**
**Problem**: `src/hooks/useChat.ts` caught all API errors and returned demo "world.org-inspired" message instead of real responses.
**Solution**: Removed demo fallback, let errors propagate properly, improved error messages.
**Files Fixed**: `src/hooks/useChat.ts` 
**Lesson**: Don't suppress errors with demo content - show actual error messages to users.

#### **3. API Response Structure Mismatch**
**Problem**: Frontend API service expected flat `{ response_text }` but backend returns nested `{ data: { response_text } }`.
**Solution**: Updated `src/services/api.ts` to handle nested structure with fallback to flat structure.
**Files Fixed**: `src/services/api.ts`
**Lesson**: Always validate actual API response structure, don't assume format.

#### **4. Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility**
**Problem**: Project used Tailwind v4 (unstable) with v3 configuration syntax.
**Solution**: Downgraded to stable Tailwind v3.4.17, updated postcss.config.mjs, fixed missing color definitions.
**Files Fixed**: `package.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`
**Lesson**: Use stable versions for production deployments.

#### **5. Multiple Vercel Deployments Confusion**
**Problem**: Multiple deployment URLs created confusion about which one is live.
**Solution**: Main domain is always `https://soccer-scout-ui.vercel.app` - this is what users click from dashboard.
**Lesson**: Document primary domains clearly, check `npx vercel inspect` to see domain aliases.

### 🌐 **Production URLs (VERIFIED WORKING)**
- **Frontend**: https://soccer-scout-ui.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://soccer-scout-api-production.up.railway.app

### ✅ **Deployment Verification Commands**
```bash
# Test backend health
curl -s "https://soccer-scout-api-production.up.railway.app/health" | jq '.status'

# Test frontend API
curl -X POST "https://soccer-scout-ui.vercel.app/api/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Compare Haaland vs Mbappé"}' | jq '.data.response_text'

# Check Vercel deployment status
npx vercel inspect https://soccer-scout-ui.vercel.app
```

### 🔧 **Development Workflow for Future Changes**
1. **Local Testing**: Always test API responses locally first
2. **Response Structure**: Verify `{ data: { response_text } }` format from backend
3. **Error Handling**: Let real errors show, don't mask with fallbacks
4. **Deployment**: Use `npx vercel --prod --force` for immediate deployment
5. **Verification**: Test main domain `soccer-scout-ui.vercel.app` after deployment
