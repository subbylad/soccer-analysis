# CLAUDE.md - Soccer Analytics Project Memory

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is an **AI-powered soccer scout** built on top of a comprehensive Python-based soccer analytics toolkit. The project has evolved from basic analytics into an intelligent system that combines GPT-4 reasoning with soccer data analysis to create a conversational scout interface.

**Current Goal**: Complete transformation into **Soccer Scout AI** - a chat-first interface with GPT-4 intelligence that can handle complex tactical queries like "Who can play alongside Kobbie Mainoo in Ligue 1?" and provide tactical reasoning.

## 📊 Current Data & Coverage
- **Source**: FBref (Football Reference) 2024/25 season data
- **Scale**: 2,853 players from 96 teams across Big 5 European leagues
- **Data Types**: Standard stats, shooting, passing, defense metrics
- **Location**: `data/clean/` contains processed CSV files ready for analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture & Key Components

### Core Analysis Engine (`analysis/`)
- **`CleanPlayerAnalyzer`**: Main analysis class - the heart of the system
- **`utils.py`**: Shared utilities including potential scoring algorithm and position filtering
- **Specialized modules**: Young DM scouting, position-specific analysis
- **Key Features**: Player search, comparison, prospect identification, statistical analysis

### 🧠 GPT-4 Enhanced Natural Language API (`api/`) 
- **`main_api.py`**: Central coordinator with OpenAI integration support
- **`query_processor.py`**: **NEW** 4-tier query processing with GPT-4 tactical analysis
- **`analysis_router.py`**: Routes queries including new TacticalAnalysisRequest type
- **`response_formatter.py`**: Creates chat-friendly responses with scout reasoning
- **`types.py`**: Enhanced with `TacticalAnalysisRequest` for complex scout queries

### User Interfaces (`dashboards/`)

- **`chat_interface.py`**: Conversational interface using the API
- **`simple_chat.py`**: Lightweight chat interface (port 8503)
- **`quick_demo.py`**: Command-line demonstration tool

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. Player Analysis
```python
from analysis.clean_player_analyzer import CleanPlayerAnalyzer
analyzer = CleanPlayerAnalyzer()
players = analyzer.search_players("Pedri")
comparison = analyzer.compare_players(["Haaland", "Mbappé"])
```

### 2. GPT-4 Enhanced Tactical Queries
```python
from api.main_api import SoccerAnalyticsAPI, APIConfig
# Initialize with OpenAI support
config = APIConfig(openai_api_key="your-key-here")
api = SoccerAnalyticsAPI(config)

# Traditional queries (pattern matching)
result = api.query("Compare Haaland vs Mbappé")

# Complex tactical queries (GPT-4 enhanced)
result = api.query("Who can play alongside Kobbie Mainoo in Ligue 1?")
result = api.query("Find an alternative to Rodri for Man City's system")
```

### 3. Young Prospect Scouting
- **Potential Scoring Algorithm** with configurable weights:
  - Goals/assists per 90 (3.0x weight)
  - Expected goals/assists (5.0x weight) 
  - Progressive actions (0.05x/0.02x weight)
  - Age factor (10.0x * (23 - age))
- **Tier Classification**: Elite ⭐, High 🌟, Good 💫, Developing 📈

## 🚀 How to Run

### Web Dashboard (Recommended)
```bash
python3 run_dashboard.py
# Opens at http://localhost:8501
```

### Chat Interface  
```bash
python3 -m streamlit run dashboards/simple_chat.py --server.port 8503
# Opens at http://localhost:8503
```

### GPT-4 Enhanced API Testing
