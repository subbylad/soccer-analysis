## 🧠 Enhanced Capabilities

### **GPT-4 Powered Tactical Queries**

The system now handles sophisticated tactical analysis queries that were previously impossible:

#### **1. Tactical Partnership Analysis**
```
Query: "Who can play alongside Kobbie Mainoo in Ligue 1?"
Result: AI identifies 8-12 midfield partners based on complementary styles
```

#### **2. Player Replacement Analysis** 
```
Query: "Find an alternative to Rodri for Manchester City"
Result: AI analyzes 5-8 DMs who can replicate Rodri's tactical role
```

#### **3. Style-Based Player Matching**
```
Query: "Show me players similar to Pedri's style"  
Result: AI finds 6-10 playmakers with similar technical attributes
```

#### **4. Formation-Specific Analysis**
```
Query: "Who would complement Bellingham in Real Madrid's midfield?"
Result: AI recommends 7-11 midfielders for tactical balance
```

#### **5. Advanced Constraint Handling**
```
Query: "Find young defensive midfielders under 25 who can replace Casemiro"
Result: AI combines age, position, and tactical requirements
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Basic Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install openai

# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Test installation
python3 test_gpt_production.py
```

### **2. API Usage**
```python
from api.main_api import SoccerAnalyticsAPI, APIConfig

# Initialize with GPT-4 support
config = APIConfig(openai_api_key="your-key")
api = SoccerAnalyticsAPI(config)

# Traditional query (fast, free)
result = api.query("Compare Haaland vs Mbappé")

# Tactical query (AI-powered)
result = api.query("Who can play alongside Kobbie Mainoo?")

# Access results
print(result['chat_text'])  # Formatted response
print(result['success'])    # Success status
```

### **3. Validation**
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python3 test_gpt_production.py  # Should show 100% success

# Test with real API
python3 test_gpt_integration.py  # Requires API key

# See examples
python3 tactical_query_examples.py
```
